Notes
-----

The program ilp runs a number of simple floating point operations on the GPU,
where the number of threads is increased from 32 to 1024 and the number of
instructions per thread is varied from 16 to 1.

The program outputs the mean time normalized to the number of instructions, and
the ratio of runtime between multiple instructions per thread and one
instruction per thread. The purpose of these ratios is to demonstrate the
performance gain of ILP.

For a small number of threads, many instructions per thread need only a
fraction of time per instruction compared to only one instruction per thread,
and more instructions yield more performance gain than fewer instructions (0.1
to 0.3, except for 32 threads and ILP16 which consistently yields outliers).
However for increasing number of threads, this gain and the difference between
the number of instructions decreases (0.6 for >= 928 threads and all ILP
configurations).
